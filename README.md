## Machine Intelligence Course, Week 3 ##

This repository contains two Tensorflow tutorials.

### tensorflow_tutorial.ipynb ###

A basic Tensorflow tutorial that starts with the description of the Tensorflow 
computational graph and ends with a simple linear regression model.

### cats_vs_dogs.ipynb and cats_vs_dogs_with_opencv.ipynb ###
 
Train a convolutional neural network to recognize cats and dogs. You can either work with images directly
(cats_vs_dogs_with_opencv.ipynb) or download a preprocessed version in the form of numpy arrays (cats_vs_dogs.ipynb).
